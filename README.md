# New Relic Chef Cookbook

`newrelic-install` is a [Chef cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/newrelic-install) that will help you scale your New Relic Observability efforts. It uses the [New Relic CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli) and [New Relic Open Installation repository](https://github.com/newrelic/open-install-library) to achieve this.

Currently, we have included Linux and Windows support for New Relic's Infrastructure and Logs integrations, with more agents and integrations following in the near future.

**Note: Installing specific versions of an agent is not supported, this cookbook will always install latest released version of a New Relic agent.**
